					<h5>Summary</h5>
					<p>
						TA hours provide students the chance to get essential one-on-one help on coursework and concepts. However, unstructured
						TA hours can often be hectic, with each student vying for the limited time of the TAs. The University of Utah School of
						Computing has helped mitigate that problem by creating a TA queue system which students enter during TA hours and are
						helped in the order they entered the queue. Unfortunately, this system is currently limited to just the School of
						Computing. Registration and login are handled entirely outside of the Learning Management System used by the university
						as a whole, Canvas.
						A TA queue system available directly within Canvas would provide the benefits of the SoC's system to all classes within
						our university, as well as any school using Canvas. It also would enable much easier usage by students, TAs and
						professors, as the queue would be associated with the class in Canvas and TA availability could be entered when setting
						up course information. Additionally, an option for virtual assistance would allow students to receive help remotely over
						a video conference with a shared digital whiteboard. Ultimately, the Canvas-integrated TA queue would allow for more
						efficient and directed TA hours and increase student success as a result.
